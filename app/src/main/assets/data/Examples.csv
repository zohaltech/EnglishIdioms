233;Everyone seemed to have  a specific role except me. I felt like a  fifth wheel
234;First and foremost I  want to thank our hosts for their wonderful  reception.
235;If you go to the  interview dressed like that, you won't get  to first base!
236;Tickets for the match  will be sold on a 'first come first served'  basis.
237;Getting to see the  performance (at) first hand is much better  than watching it on television.
238;Sandra was so  enthusiastic about the project that she was  first out of the gate.
239;Why didn't you tell me  he was your boyfriend in the first place?
240;The violinist gave a  performance that was of the first water
